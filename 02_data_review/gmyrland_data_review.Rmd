# Introduction
<!--
    First, provide the context of the problem and then state the problem (your main research question). 
    Second, write briefly that what are you proposing to solve this problem (don’t write details of the 
    solution here). (You can use part of your abstract here)
-->

<!-- Abstract for reference:
    Automotive accidents result in over 30,000 fatalities in the United States annually. The National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) provides a nationally representative sample of police reported collisions and is made available to researchers and the general public.
    
    The research question is to identify and quantify factors which impact the survivability of various crash types (Rear-end, Sideswipe, etc) using R, and potentially create a web app using the shiny package to predict survivability for given inputs using regression.
    
    Techniques will include web-scraping, xml-parsing and data cleaning of real-world dataset, exploratory analysis to identify relevant factors, feature engineering, and linear regression.
-->

# Literature Review
<!--
    Write summary of the related papers that you reviewed here.  Write the summary in your own 
    words—don’t use the technical jargon from the paper that you don’t understand. Keep this section 
    short—a short paragraph or few sentences about each paper you reviewed should be sufficient.
-->

# Dataset
<!--
    Give the description of the dataset that you are using along with the individual attributes you will or will 
    not use in your analysis. Also mention the source of the dataset (where did you get it from). In case the 
    data is curated and created by you please explain the details. Descriptive statistics of the attributes and 
    datasets can also be provided here.
-->

# Approach
<!--
    Create a block diagram for the steps of your approach to clearly provide an overview. For example, if 
    you first scrapped twitter, second applied NLP techniques to extract keywords, third labelled the tweets 
    as positive and negative using a set of keywords, and fourth build a classifier, then you should create a 
    box for each of the steps with arrows connecting one step to the next one. A sample block diagram is 
    shown below.
    Once this is done, explain each of the steps in detail. What are you planning to do in each step or have 
    already done. For example, in the above case you would create subheadings for each of the steps.

## Step 1: Compile complete list of Case Ids
<!--
    Write details of the step 1. If there is any source code that you’d like to share then provide the link of 
    the Github.
-->

Case data in XML for each collision can be found using a url of the form:\newline http://www-nass.nhtsa.dot.gov/nass/cds/CaseForm.aspx?GetXML&caseid=112007272.

In order to obtain data for each collision, it was necessary to obtain all Case Ids.
As there was no obvious source for the complete set of ids, and the numerical values of the ids were too sparse for brute force web scraping, a method was devised to quickly pull all ids from the results list of an empty search.

The complete set of results can be found using the link:\newline
http://www-nass.nhtsa.dot.gov/nass/cds/ListForm.aspx

A Windows application [True X-Mouse Gizmo](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/nt/TXMouse/) was used to emulate the Linux behaviour of copying any selected text to the system clipboard.
A macro in the [vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor was then used to paste the clipboard contents to a text file at a rate of once per second.
Navigating through the result list and selecting all text with `Ctrl+A` allowed for quick harvesting of all 49,345 case ids in an unstructured format (found here [nass_case_ids.txt](https://github.com/gmyrland/capstone_project/blob/master/data/nass_case_ids.txt)).
The result was then filtered for only unique lines ending containing the regular expression `[0-9]\{9,9}$`, again using [vim](http://www.vim.org).
The provided the original tabular result data in a structured manner, with the last numerical sequence on each line being the case id ([nass_case_ids_filtered.txt](https://github.com/gmyrland/capstone_project/blob/master/data/nass_case_ids_filtered.txt)).
